# DRSM: EFFICIENT NEURAL 4D DECOMPOSITION FOR DYNAMIC RECONSTRUCTION IN STATIONARY MONOCULAR CAMERAS
This is the code for DRSM, a novel framework to tackle 4D decomposition problem for dynamic scenes in monocular cameras. Created by Weixing Xie, Xiao Dong from Xiamen University.

Our model is trained and tested under:
* tiny-cuda-nn
* jax
* tensorboard
* open3d
* tqdm
* torch-cuda
* pillow
* opencv-python
* pandas
* lpips
* torchmetrics
* scikit-image
* imageio
* nerfacc
* pytorch-msssim
